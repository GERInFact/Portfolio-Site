        <h2>My journey of becoming a web developer</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019 I graduated at the SAE Institute Leipzig with a first class
          BSc.(Hons) in Games Programming, issued by the Middlesex University of
          London.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to bear in mind at this point of my story that I had the
          privilege of being appointed Director of Studies of the Games
          Programming course at the SAE Institute Leipzig in October 2016
          followed accordingly of an additional appointment at the SAE Institute
          Hannover in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my commitment to the task at hand and my Mentors great
          recommendation that led me into a management role, which I had to
          follow for the next 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period I developed a revised course program, which drew
          the attention of international software companies of the likes of
          Crytek, Unity and Daedalic.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was probably the moment I sat down with the brilliant minds of
          Collin Bishop and Brian Dilg, I was inspired to focus more and more on
          software engineering and especially on design principles as well as
          clean code that led me to my current software engineering role at eder
          GmbH where I've taken part in the development of great software
          solutions for Mars, BMW, Daimler and MAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I've realized the tremendous impact of web based software
          solutions, capable of minimizing OS restrictions and accessibility
          issues for clients that ignited my passion for web and cloud
          development.
